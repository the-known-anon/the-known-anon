# Hey there!~
Welcome to my profile, I hope you have a nice stay  :D
I have experience coding in C++,python, R, C, HTML-CSS and Javascript. 

Machine Learning has always piqued my interest.It seems so fascinating to know that a machine can learn just like a human.With Python being lingua franca for Machine
Learning,I have made myself well versed with Python.Along with that, I have done 3 out of 5 courses of “Deep Learning specialization” by “deeplearning.ai(Andrew Ng)” on
Coursera and also to make myself familiar with Tensorflow,I have completed the “Intro to TensorFlow” by Google Cloud. Well, I believe that,just learning and understanding the
concepts of ML is not enough, one needs to know how to develop and train models as well.
